			<h1>Dear Codam students!</h1>

			<p>The Student Council would like to present you with a list of
candidates running for the coming term. The 4 winning ones will be
representing you for the next 8 months, from August until March 2022.</p>

			<p>The elections will be held in the week of the 19<sup>nd</sup> - 25<sup>th</sup> of July. You will receive a link to a voting system in which you can rank the candidates to your liking. You can also choose to abstain. The top 4 candidates will become the Council members. For this term we are testing preferential/ranked voting to get a fairer method of fixing ties, <a href="https://electionbuddy.com/preferential/" target="_blank" referrer="">you can read about that on this electionbuddy page</a>. The voting is fully anonymous and the results of the elections will be known only after it is finished.</p>

			<p>It is very important for us and the candidates that you vote. Your participation gives us the legitimacy to represent you. Please get to know the candidates and their motivation to join the Student Council.</p>

						<p>Every organisation needs rules to make sure that its members are treated equally and fairly. The 42 system and Codam work so well because they have hardly any rules on how you have to do your work. But, the fewer the rules, the more important every individual rule is.<br>The main ideas of the system are great. There are however a few details that still need some work. That is something I want to do.</p>

			<h1>Continuing current Council members</h1>

			<p>Codam Student Council hosts elections every 4 months but eachmember serves for 8 months. That is because the terms are overlapping.Every four months, a part of the council members leaves and new membersjoin in their place, keeping the total number of council members at six. This structure aims at transferring knowledge between the terms. In the coming term, starting in August, the winning candidates will join the following members from the previous Council representation. </p>

						<p>I'm dedicated to promoting accessibility at Codam as well as helping out standardising procedures and writing advisory documents on how to better support various student populations at Codam. I believe awareness and education can help many people understand and familiarise themselves with concepts beyond their initial comfort zone.</p>

						<p>My (almost) two years at Codam have turned to be quite hectic.<br>I've seen a lot of peers (hehe) lose touch with the curriculum and drop out.<br>Right now it's up to us to figure out what works, what doesn't and what we need to do to make Codam great again.<br>And if you let me, I hope I can be of help.<br>That, and I think I could be a much needed voice for the underrepresented Codam Advanced.</p>

						<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Irem from 2020 Cohort. Even if you donâ€™t know me, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve heard about my ridiculously long last name. I plan to work on the ambiguity of evaluation sheets, the possibility to evaluate curriculum, and boosting p2p environment. If youâ€™d like to see a female/international representative at the Student Council, vote for me! Iâ€™ll make sure our unique names are pronounced correctly ðŸ¥³</p>

						<p>I would love to be part of the student council because I really believe in Codam. My experience here has also taught me that we could do better in some areas. I'd love to help improve those!<br>If I became part of the student council, I'd focus on making sure we're doing everything we can to ensure that Codam's ideals are reflected in the experience of studying here. Will trade cookies for votes!</p>

			<h1>What is a Student Council?</h1>

			<p>A Student Council is a delegation of students within a school that serves the interests of students at that school. The Student Council at Codam consists of six students. These students represent the entire student body in conversations with (delegates) of the Bocal.  The Student Council is built to support students by speaking to the Bocal on their behalf, generate ideas to improve education and life in general at Codam and improve the connection between the students and the Bocal. The Student Councilâ€™s goal is to help Codam provide its students with the best possible education. Areas the Student Council can be focussing on are, for example, education quality (e.g. curriculum and evaluations), student support (financial and mental), facilities, and admissions (new students, piscines, selection). We strive to have a team as diverse as possible with regards to cohort, nationality, gender etc.</p>
