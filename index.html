				<p>I'm gonna be honest with you, even I'm not sure if I would be a good candidate for student council. What I do know is that this school has been extremely kind to me and the people I have met at this school over the short period of time have changed my life, so I would like to give my best to give back all the kindness I have received from the wonderful community we all call Codam.

				<p>Hi! I’m Vincent. I like to cook, dance, code and fix flaws in systems. That last one generally is quite useless unless you are in a position to influence things. I think I’d be of value to the council with my critical view and ability to keep asking questions. I'm interested in and read a lot about: privacy, equality, improving peer-to-peer feedback, code quality, black hole system, communication.</p>

				<p>Hi there, I am from cohort Oct 2020. As a former secondary school, Montessori teacher, finding your own path and learning from your peers is great, but for everyone it can be a different experience. I would like, with your support, give back to Codam as a member of the student council. To help and advocate on behalf of cohorts, groups of students or individuals to the Staff. Thanks, Cheers Dave</p>

			<h1>Continuing current Council members</h1>

			<p>Codam Student Council hosts elections every 4 months but each member serves for 8 months. That is because the terms are overlapping. Every four months, a part of the council members leaves and new members join in their place, keeping the total number of council members at six. This structure aims at transferring knowledge between the terms. In the coming term, starting in April, the winning candidates will join the following members from the previous Council representation. </p>

			<h1>What is a Student Council?</h1>

			<p>A Student Council is a delegation of students within a school that serves the interests of students at that school. The Student Council at Codam consists of six students. These students represent the entire student body in conversations with (delegates) of the Bocal.  The Student Council is built to support students by speaking to the Bocal on their behalf, generate ideas to improve education and life in general at Codam and improve the connection between the students and the Bocal. The Student Council’s goal is to help Codam provide its students with the best possible education. Areas the Student Council can be focussing on are, for example, education quality (e.g. curriculum and evaluations), student support (financial and mental), facilities, and admissions (new students, piscines, selection). We strive to have a team as diverse as possible with regards to cohort, nationality, gender etc.</p>
