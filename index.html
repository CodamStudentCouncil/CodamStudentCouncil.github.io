			<h1>Dear Codam students!</h1>

			<p>The Student Council would like to present you with a list of
candidates running for the coming term. The 5 winning ones will be
representing you for the next 8 months, from December until July 2022.</p>

			<p>The elections will be held in the week of the 22<sup>nd</sup> - 28<sup>th</sup> of November. You will receive a link to a voting system in which you can rank the candidates to your liking. You can also choose to abstain. The top 5 candidates will become the Council members. For this term we are testing preferential/ranked voting to get a fairer method of fixing ties, <a href="https://electionbuddy.com/preferential/" target="_blank" referrer="">you can read about that on this electionbuddy page</a>. The voting is fully anonymous and the results of the elections will be known only after it is finished.</p>

			<p>It is very important for us and the candidates that you vote. Your participation gives us the legitimacy to represent you. Please get to know the candidates and their motivation to join the Student Council.</p>

			<h1>Continuing current Council members</h1>

			<p>The Codam Student Council hosts elections every 4 months but each member serves for 8 months. That is because the terms are overlapping.Every four months, a part of the council members leaves and new membersjoin in their place, keeping the total number of council members at six. This structure aims at transferring knowledge between the terms. In the coming term, starting in December, the winning candidates will join the following members from the previous Council representation.</p>

						<p>I'm dedicated to promoting accessibility at Codam as well as helping out standardising procedures and writing advisory documents on how to better support various student populations at Codam. I believe awareness and education can help many people understand and familiarise themselves with concepts beyond their initial comfort zone.</p>

						<p>My (almost) two years at Codam have turned to be quite hectic.<br>I've seen a lot of peers (hehe) lose touch with the curriculum and drop out.<br>Right now it's up to us to figure out what works, what doesn't and what we need to do to make Codam great again.<br>And if you let me, I hope I can be of help.<br>That, and I think I could be a much needed voice for the underrepresented Codam Advanced.</p>

						<p>I would love to be part of the student council because I really believe in Codam. My experience here has also taught me that we could do better in some areas. I'd love to help improve those!<br>If I became part of the student council, I'd focus on making sure we're doing everything we can to ensure that Codam's ideals are reflected in the experience of studying here. Will trade cookies for votes!</p>

			<h1>What is a Student Council?</h1>

			<p>A Student Council is a delegation of students within a school that serves the interests of students at that school. The Student Council at Codam consists of six students. These students represent the entire student body in conversations with (delegates) of the Bocal.  The Student Council is built to support students by speaking to the Bocal on their behalf, generate ideas to improve education and life in general at Codam and improve the connection between the students and the Bocal. The Student Councilâ€™s goal is to help Codam provide its students with the best possible education. Areas the Student Council can be focussing on are, for example, education quality (e.g. curriculum and evaluations), student support (financial and mental), facilities, and admissions (new students, piscines, selection). We strive to have a team as diverse as possible with regards to cohort, nationality, gender etc.</p>

				Expanding and improving how the student council works by making the role of student council \"deputies\" so that the council can delegate some of the workload to students."
